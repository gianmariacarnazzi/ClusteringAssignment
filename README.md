# ClusteringAssignment
In this project we applied some of the most known clustering methods in order to analyze data of energy consumption. The interesting thing is that we were able to obtain exactly the same clustering using different methods: density-based, centroids-based and hierarchical ones. Furthermore, we show how is possible to use nonlinear transformations (tSNE) also in clustering problems, even though they do not preserve distances, if you pay attention at the feature-composition of you clusters and you can compare it with other results.
